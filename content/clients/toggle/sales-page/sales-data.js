    services:["Paid advertising","Making the ads","Reporting"],

    stats:[{v:"32,000+",l:"enquiries worth following up"},{v:"47%",l:"cheaper for each enquiry"},{v:"77%",l:"of all education ads seen in Malaysia"}],
    challenge:"By the middle of 2024 they were paying RM154 for every enquiry from Google, RM291 from Facebook and RM525 from TikTok, and each extra ringgit was buying less than the one before it. At the same time the university needed more students, not fewer.",
    method:["Wrote a different message for each stage a student goes through, from first hearing of the university to actually applying, so we were never saying the same thing to everyone.","Gave every platform one job. Google reached people already searching for a course, Meta reached people still deciding, and TikTok reached people who had not thought about studying yet.","Connected the university's own enrolment records back to Google and Meta, so those platforms learned which enquiries turned into real students instead of guessing.","Merged campaigns that were competing against each other, and narrowed the targeting from anyone at all to people who had shown real interest, plus people who looked like the students who had already enrolled.","Paced the spending carefully enough to go past RM11 million a month without the cost of an enquiry going up."],
    transfer:"Spreading your advertising across several platforms only helps if each one has a different job. If all 3 are chasing the same person, you end up competing against your own ads, and that is the most common reason the cost of an enquiry creeps up as budgets grow." },
  { id:"mindvalley", client:"Mindvalley Labs", year:"2019 to 2022", vertical:"education", geo:"Global",
    services:["Paid advertising","Making the ads","Getting more visitors to buy"],

    stats:[{v:"$100 to $10",l:"cost of one business enquiry"},{v:"4x",l:"return on ad spend"},{v:"+100%",l:"more money kept after costs"}],
    challenge:"One product sold into several countries with 2 revenue models side by side, so a blended target would have hidden which half of the business was losing money. 4 separate studios produced creative with no shared standard for a winning concept.",
    method:["Moved the business enquiries onto forms that asked the qualifying questions up front, so people who were never going to buy stopped reaching the sales team at all.","Tried the same 5 different approaches on one audience every round, and judged them on how many people clicked, how many installed the app, and what each install cost.","Broke the results down by whether men or women responded and by age. The community approach drew 89 percent men, mostly aged 18 to 34, while the benefit approach appealed evenly to everyone over 25.","Told the 4 studios exactly which single thing to change each time, such as the headline or the opening shot, rather than giving them opinions. For the first time their work could be compared fairly.","Fixed the product listings so the ad systems could automatically show the right product to people who had not visited the site before."],
    transfer:"5 angles against one audience produces 2 winners, because different angles recruit different people. Splitting results by who responded, instead of only by what performed, turns a creative test into an audience strategy." },

    stats:[{v:"+52.6%",l:"more appearances in Google"},{v:"+34.5%",l:"more clicks from Google, unpaid"}],
    challenge:"Their product pages were not ranking, competitors covered each subject far more thoroughly than they did, and they published so slowly that nothing ever built up.",
    method:["Repositioned the program from page-level fixes to a content-led authority model built for financial scrutiny.","Grouped the subjects so that every new article made the articles already published stronger, instead of competing with them.","Aligned page intent with what searchers were trying to do, not with internal product naming."],
    transfer:"In industries that are watched closely, Google trusts you because you cover a subject thoroughly, and no amount of links from other websites will make up for not doing that. The same approach works for insurance, healthcare and education." },

    challenge:"Core insurance terms had been stuck at position 3 in a category where search engines apply extra scrutiny to accuracy and authorship.",
    method:["Rebuilt the pages around the searches made by people who were actually ready to buy, so Google could see those pages were the best answer.","Rewrote each page to answer the question people were actually typing into Google, rather than naming the product the way the company names it internally.","Made it clear on every page who wrote it, what they know about the subject, and where the information came from, because Google weighs all 3."],
    transfer:"When a page has sat in the same position for months, the problem is usually what the page tells Google about itself, not how much has been written. Working out which takes days, and you can measure whether the fix worked." },

    challenge:"Target terms sat at position 4 in a market where the top 3 results take the great majority of the clicks.",
    method:["Applied the model proven on Singlife, adapted to a different product set.","Prioritized the terms where a one position move produced the largest click gain."],
    transfer:"2 insurers in the same market with the same outcome is a method. Ask us to show you both." },

    challenge:"Their free reach on TikTok and their ordinary sales campaigns had both stopped growing, and adding more budget was no longer making any difference.",
    method:["Sorted the products into 3 groups instead of treating them all the same. Best sellers got the most money, middle performers stayed in testing, and slow stock was cleared with as little spend as possible.","Built a network of creators who post about the books themselves, because videos that look like a real person talking sell far better than polished brand adverts.","Made different ads for each group, built around the reason people actually buy that kind of book."],
    transfer:"Cutting budget from low performers freed the capital that tripled revenue from the best sellers. Waste reduction moved the number more than scaling winners did." },

    transfer:"Creative testing is the foundation, and it never stops being one. Localized angles per market are what make international scale possible on one budget." },

    transfer:"Checking what competitors were advertising before deciding where to advertise is what produced the RM35 cost per enquiry. What we did was ordinary. Where we chose to do it was not." }

   THE BOOK. One row per account Toggle has run or is running.

   `caseId`  pulls the full published case out of CASES above.
   `logo`    is a path under assets/logos/clients/. When present the chip and
             the modal render the image instead of the name. 43 of the rows
             below carry one and render as a mark in the carousel; the rest
             are in the book and in every count, and do not appear on the
             wall. Drop a file in and add the one field.
   `proved`  is set automatically for entries with a caseId or stats.

   HONESTY RULE: an entry gets `line`, `stats` or `method` only where the repo
   documents it. Everything else carries `unpublished` and says so on the card.
   Fill in clients/<slug>/CLIENT.md and the card upgrades itself.

   THE BOOK IS THE CLIENT LIST. Every account we claim on either page is a row
   here, and every counter is computed from these rows (see DERIVED COUNTS at
   the foot of this file). There is no hand-typed total to keep in step. To
   claim another client, add the row.
